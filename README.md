# Question Generation
* Given a document (for example the text of a document from Wikipedia), the module should generate a set of questions relevant to that document. The goal is to generate questions that are fluent and reasonable. That is, they should be grammatically correct and in idomatic English, and they should also be answerable based on the information in the document.

* where article.txt is a path to an arbitrary plain text file (the article) and num_questions is an integer which represents the number of questions to be generated. The program should output to STDOUT a sequence of questions which each question printed on a newline.

# Question Answering
* Given a plain text document and a set of questions, the module should return an answer for each question. The goal is to produce answers that are fluent, correct and concise. That is the answers should be in idiomatic / grammatically correct English, they should be correct according to the document and they should not contain any extra words.

* where article.txt is a path to an arbitrary plain text file (the article) and questions.txt is a path to an arbitrary file of questions (one question per line with no extraneous material). The output (to STDOUT) should contain a sequence of answers with each answer terminated by a newline character.
